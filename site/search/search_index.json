FRDR is managed by the Digital Research Alliance, and data deposit is open to any researcher affiliated with a Canadian institution. While institutional affiliation is part of the metadata attached to a deposit, data is organized by discipline- or project-based collections rather than by institution. FRDR was originally built for large datasets using special software to transfer files, but now supports smaller datasets as well with browser-based uploads. FRDR staff are available to work with researchers and perform data curation in-house, rather than requiring libraries to perform that work.</p> <p>There is no fee to deposit data in FRDR.</p>"},{"location":"initiatives/rdm-decision-support/#features-benefits-and-drawbacks","title":"Features, benefits, and drawbacks","text":"Borealis FRDR Institution has its own instance/platform, URL, and institutional branding Single shared platform organized by discipline or project Data deposits discoverable/searchable within the institution's instance, and alongside other deposits in the Borealis platform Data deposits are discoverable/searchable in the FRDR platform, organized by Collections based on discipline or project and not by institutional affiliation Institution responsible for managing its own software instance Software centrally managed Indexed in DataCite search, Google datasetsearch, Lunaris for discoverability Indexed in DataCite search, Google datasetsearch, Lunaris for discoverability Integrated with institutional SSO Integrated with institutional SSO DOI automatically minted DOI automatically minted Focus on smaller or medium-sized datasets Supports both very large datasets and smaller datasets Institution responsible for data curation Has dedicated data curation staff available to support deposits Institution responsible for all researcher support FRDR can work directly with researchers (level of institutional involvement is the institution's choice) Supports access restrictions Supports access restrictions for sensitive data Annual fee based on institution size ($1,000 to $15,000) No fees Demo server: https://demo.borealisdata.ca/ Demo server: https://demo.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/"},{"location":"initiatives/rdm-decision-support/#data-deposits-in-arca","title":"Data deposits in Arca","text":"<p>Arca members may consider depositing datasets into Arca, bearing the following in mind:</p> <ul> <li>There is a cost to excess Arca storage, while Borealis and FRDR have higher or no storage limitations.
